Project Proposal List:
- Webapp in c/c++ 
    We have an idea to make a database style webapp to help
    the user keep track of items that they have aquired in
    the Animal Crossing New Horizons video game and inform
    the user of when the items they have not aquired will
    return in the following year.
- Server Programming
    We could create a packet sniffer that analyzes and 
    monitors traffic data that passes over a network. 
- Android App
    We could create an app where the user has to tap the
    screen in rythm to match the notes played previously.
    So a matching rythm game with fun music and screen
    effects.
